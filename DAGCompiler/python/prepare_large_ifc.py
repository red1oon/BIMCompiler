prepare_large_ifc.py — ONE entry point that makes an oversized IFC processable.

WHY THIS EXISTS (read before changing it — two levers were already tried and one was given up):
  The naive route — feed the whole file to extractIFCtoDB.py — was tried on KUL070 OVERALL.ifc
  (2045 MB) and ABANDONED: systemd-oomd killed it at 44,000/66,214 elements and took the whole
  terminal with it (IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md §CRASH). The browser route hits a harder wall:
  the wasm32 address space caps at 4,294,901,760 bytes and OVERALL.ifc spends ~3.4 GB of it on PARSE
  ALONE, so geometry building dies at element #3,956 of 66,214 — quietly, with no error (§KUL009).

  The obvious fix — "strip the redundant psets" — was ALSO already tried and MEASURED DEAD for that
  file: strip_ifc_psets.py was written, superseded by strip_ifc_nonessential.py, then measured at
  psets = 1.0% of OVERALL.ifc, file -1.8%. 95.6% of it is raw tessellation (IFCPOLYLOOP 25.6% /
  IFCFACEOUTERBOUND 25.4% / IFCFACE 25.4% / IFCCARTESIANPOINT 19.2%). You cannot strip the geometry
  you came for. On CONTAINMENT.ifc the same lever gives -45.2%, because THERE the bloat really is
  metadata (psets 19.4% + ports 13.6%).

  So: THE LEVER MUST BE CHOSEN FROM THE HISTOGRAM, NEVER ASSUMED. That is this script's whole job.
  It invents nothing — it reads the entity histogram, picks strip and/or split, and drives the two
  existing proven tools.

WHAT IT DOES
  1. §PLAN   histogram both strip tiers (strip_ifc_nonessential.py --stats-only) — is the bloat
             METADATA or GEOMETRY?
  2. §STRIP  only if the model tier can remove >= --strip-min-pct of entities. Otherwise it SKIPS
             and prints the measured percentage that justifies skipping.
  3. §SPLIT  only if still over --target-part-mb. Part count is derived from the measured wasm
             budget, not guessed.
  4. §FIXPOINT  escalates --max-rounds until the splitter reports `added=0`. It NEVER accepts
             `§CLOSURE WARNING: hit --max-rounds`. That warning is not cosmetic: at the default 12
             rounds, OVERALL.ifc was short 1,148 IFCCARTESIANPOINT/IFCDIRECTION leaves and the
             geometry of 523 of 66,214 elements silently changed (§KUL011).
  5. §MANIFEST  every output part with its size + RAM forecast, ready for extractIFCtoDB.py.

MEASURED CONSTANTS (§KUL009 / §KUL011 — change only with a new measurement)
  wasm32 ceiling         4,294,901,760 B
  2045 MB source         ->  ~3.4 GB wasm on parse alone,  3,955 / 66,214 elements survive
  254-461 MB part        ->  0.8-1.4 GB,  100% of elements survive, 0 skips  (8/8 parts)
  => 500 MB/part is the default target: proven to fit with >2x headroom.

Usage
  prepare_large_ifc.py IN.ifc OUTDIR [--prefix NAME] [--target-part-mb 500]
                       [--strip-min-pct 15] [--max-parts 32] [--plan-only]

Then, per part:
  python3 DAGCompiler/python/extractIFCtoDB.py --ifc PART.ifc -o PART.db --building-type NAME
  (do NOT pass --library — it needs a pre-migrated component_library.db and aborts without one)

    A plain `INSERT OR IGNORE` across parts is WRONG TWICE and both modes were hit for real:
      1. elements_meta.id is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and per-part sequential -> ids collide and rows are
         silently DROPPED (observed: element_transforms=87,333 beside elements_meta=14,191 — a DB
         that looks fine until you join it). Fix: omit `id`, dedup on `guid UNIQUE`.

         rel_anchored/rel_spans reference it — a naive merge re-points ~500k relations at the wrong
