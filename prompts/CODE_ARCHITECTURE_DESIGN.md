# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE — SCOPE: the higher-level code design for bim-ootb (parts A–F below): turn implicit structure into declared, generated, checked structure, WITHOUT a build step, TypeScript in the app, a framework or a new runtime dependency, and keeping lazy loading. Design first: every open decision goes to the owner ONE AT A TIME, then spec, then witness-led migration in small PRs. Read the log after every run — exit code is not evidence. Honour this block until every part is ✅ or ⛔.

**Written 2026-11-13**, tracker issue BIMCompiler #599. Owner, in order:
*"i wonder if we need to design the code at a higher level? Give your take again what can be a better design"* →
*"Why not write it out fully in the prompts/# spec'd so that a new session will tackle it fresh"* →
*"also look at how VSC can have a plugin or addon that specifically handles this codebase elegantly and dev help really"*.
Background and every measurement this file cites: `prompts/EDITOR_MAINTAINABILITY_STUDY.md` (§3, §7, §12–§15), `docs/DeveloperGuide.md`
(§0, §1 patterns, §9 breakers, §11 refactors), `prompts/REFACTOR_FOR_READERS.md` (the small, readability-only list).

---

## ▶ START HERE (fresh session)

1. **Read, in order:** this file to the end · `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` §0, §1, §5, §9 · `prompts/EDITOR_MAINTAINABILITY_STUDY.md` §13 (minimalism
   guard) · bim-ootb `GOVERNANCE.md` · `CLAUDE.md` §TWIN CARDINAL RULE, §AD-LAYER LAW, §PERF BUDGET, §DB CHANGES.
2. **This is a DESIGN lane before it is a coding lane.** The owner's rule for design talk: *one detail at a time, never decide topology
   alone* (memory `feedback_design_discussion_one_detail_at_a_time`). Each part below lists its **OPEN DECISIONS**. Bring them to the owner
   one per message, with a recommendation, and record the answer **in the owner's words** in that part's `DECISIONS` block. Do not
   code a part whose decisions are open.
3. **Re-measure the baselines** (commands in §M) before quoting any number. They drift daily.
4. **Coordinate:** `ListAgents`, then ask live sessions before touching their files (owner: *"be careful not to break ongoing sessions work,
   ask the other session what it thinks first"*). `gh pr list --state open` for overlapping paths. Work in a `/tmp/wt-*` worktree off fresh
   `origin/main` (bim-ootb shared checkout is hook-blocked). Run `git worktree list` first and reuse one if it fits.
5. **FOSS flow per PR:** a tracker issue (what, baseline, witness), then branch, one small PR `Fixes #N`, conventional title, CI green, merged
   and verified on `main` before the next (`docs/DeveloperGuide.md` §10; own sessions may merge their own verified PRs).
6. **Order:** A → B → D → E → F → C (reasons in §ORDER). Status table at the end.

## RULES (any break = stop that part)

- **Minimalism (owner, 2026-11-13):** *"pure SQLite WASM resisting any forks, or TS that can overload its lightweight kernel local first
  air gapped handling"*. Nothing new may reach the browser except the code a part explicitly moves, and **no new runtime dependency**. Generators,
  manifests, `types/`, `.vscode/` and the VS Code extension are dev-side only. The extension is plain JS with no npm dependencies.
- **Lazy loading kept** (owner: *"retain its fast perf lazy loading strategy"*): nothing lazy becomes boot-loaded or precached as a side effect.
- **Twin rule:** the SQLite ERP stays the twin of legacy iDempiere, look and feel included. A difference found is fixed on the SQLite side.
- **AD-layer law:** ERP behaviour lives in the one generic dictionary engine, never per window.
- **No behaviour change without a before/after witness** that shows identical results (or, where a part fixes a real bug, an owner-approved
  issue that states the intended change, with the witness updated in the same PR).
- **Protected lane:** film/camera families (`fx_*`/`effects`, `cinema_path_editor`, `maxq_*`/`cinema_maxq`): no structural change unless the
  owner lifts `prompts/SCRIPT_LENGTH_REFACTOR_SEAMS.md` §S59.
- **No browser/GPU runs, no bakes, no paid model calls** without the owner's explicit go. Headless node witnesses are fine.
- **Instrument honesty:** code scans use a parser (espree or VS Code's TypeScript via `scripts/lib/find_ts.js`), never regex over raw source.
  Comments and strings are not code (`EDITOR_MAINTAINABILITY_STUDY.md` §9: this error was made twice in one session). A witness that judged nothing
  prints INCONCLUSIVE. Every witness has a red control.
- Status, findings and decisions go in THIS file (dated lines in each part), not in `MEMORY.md`.

## THE PROBLEM, in one table (measured 2026-11-13, bim-ootb `main` @ `cc9988c2`)

| # | Structural problem | Evidence | Who it hurts |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Dependencies are implicit | 1 production file uses ES modules; load order = `<script>` order (`viewer/viewer.html` 247, `erp/idempiere.html` 205, `modeller/modeller.html` 59); a shared object of 1,676 fields, 1,316 written only as `A.x`, **171 read in production but never written** | anyone reading or moving code |
| P2 | The same lists are kept by hand in several places | page `<script>` lists · lazy list `viewer/main.js` `modules[]` · three `PRECACHE_ASSETS` (`viewer/`, `erp/`, `modeller/sw.js`) · `?v=` tags · three `CACHE_VERSION` · `_GANTT_CACHE_VERSION` (`viewer/tm_dash.js:688`) | every edit; stale-file bugs |
| P3 | Side effects are mixed into core logic | AST scan of 299 ERP files: 59 files / 181 calls to clock, random, network. The 15 core files have 26 calls, about a dozen "today with a wall-clock fallback", written differently each time (`ad_callout.js:157`, `:840`, `doc_poster.js:203`, `model_asi.js:70`, `processes/InvoiceGenerate.js:38`, `processes/ImportOrder.js:68`, the other `Import*`/generate processes) | correctness of replay; testability |
| P4 | No app-wide owner list | duplicates found by accident: `ERPKernel` in `erp/erp_kernel.js` and `erp/odoo_agent/erp_kernel.js`; `modeller/routewalker.js` vs `viewer/routewalker.js`; `Bonsai` ×3 and `ERP` ×4 publishers; a 12-way clock. Only the 4D lane has an owner table (`prompts/4D_MODEL_INTEGRITY.md` §I) | anyone fixing a bug in "the" implementation |
| P5 | Proof is scattered | witnesses in `modeller/tests` 368 · `viewer/tests` 317 · `erp/tests` 303 · `witness/` 203 · `tests/` 28 · `scripts/tests`; 65 files use `witness_kit/contract.js`; 636 files hard-code the author's home folder; no lookup "which witness proves this file / rule" | reviewers; a second machine |

Each item in `REFACTOR_FOR_READERS.md` patches one symptom. This design removes the causes.

---

## PART A — A pure core with one Env handed in   (fixes P3, half of P4)

**Design.** Split code into two kinds:
- **Core:** ERP verbs, posting, processes, callouts, the op-log fold, schedule/CPM maths, geometry maths. Plain calculation: data in, results out.
  **No** `Date`, `Math.random`, `crypto.randomUUID`, `fetch`, `window`, `document`, storage, or `console` outside a `§` log helper.
- **Edge (shell):** UI, Three.js, panels, service worker, IndexedDB/OPFS, network.

Everything core needs from outside arrives through **one Env object**: `now()`, `today()`, `newId()`, `fetchSource()` (if any), `log(§…)`.
The edge mints each value **once** and records it in the op, so a replay reads the recorded value and never asks the clock again. This is
iDempiere's own pattern: the working date lives in the session context (`Env.java:110` `DATE = "#Date"`; 39 iDempiere source files read it with
`Env.getContextAsDate(ctx, Env.DATE)`), and the twin already carries `#Date` (`erp/ad_callout.js:116`). So the twin rule is honoured, not bent.
It also makes `docs/DistributedERP.md` §7 (*"nondeterministic values … generated at the edge and recorded as inputs … kernel only reads"*) true by
construction and checkable, which closes the DeepSeek review's point "we have a rule vs we enforce a rule".

**Owner file:** the determinism rule is already owned by `prompts/BACKEND_SUBSTRATE_LANE.md` (scope block: *"deterministic on every fold/replay
path (ids/ts/balances are recorded INPUTS, no Date.now()/Math.random())"*). Part A is carried out under that lane's rules. Record progress here and
add one dated pointer line there.

**Step A0 — settle the open fact first (witness, no code change):** when the op-log replays, does it RE-RUN a process (which would pick up a new
"today" on a later day) or replay the ROWS the process wrote? Witness `W-REPLAY-CLOCK`: run a dated process (e.g. InvoiceGenerate) with a fixed
injected date, replay the log under a different wall clock (fake `Date`), compare the replay hash with the live hash. Equal → the fallbacks are tidy-up
(A2). Different → a real bug. Open an issue that states it, and fix it in A1 before anything else. Existing harnesses to reuse, not rewrite:
`prompts/KERNEL_COMMITGROUP.md` item F (replay-hash across device logs), `prompts/RESUME_PROVE_BOOKS_MONITOR.md` (`replay-hash == live-hash`).

**Steps:** A1 the Env object (one owner file; name per OPEN DECISION 2), taking its date from the login context the way legacy does · A2 move
each core file's clock/ID reads onto it, one file per PR, posting/parity witnesses identical before/after · A3 **scan witness `W-CORE-PURE`**: an
AST scan of the core file list that fails on any forbidden call outside the Env owner and the `§` log helper. **Red control:** a copied core verb
with a planted `Date.now()` must make it FAIL. Prints `§CORE_PURE files= forbidden= verdict=`.

**OPEN DECISIONS (ask one at a time):**
1. Which files are "core"? Proposal: the 15 measured core ERP files + `viewer/cpm_schedule.js`, `viewer/schedule_*.js`, `viewer/tm_core.js`,
   `common/room_graph.js` maths. Owner confirms the list.
2. Does Env extend the twin's existing context object (`AdCallout`'s `Env`/`#Date`) or is it a new small object that the context feeds? Proposal:
   extend the existing one, because legacy has one context.
3. What happens when no date was injected (today: wall-clock fallback)? Proposal: the EDGE supplies it at session start (`SESSION_START` op already
   records `ts`, `erp/kernel_ops.js:941`). Core never falls back.

**Witnesses:** W-REPLAY-CLOCK (A0) · W-CORE-PURE (A3, red control) · per migrated file: its posting/parity witnesses identical · ERP parallel run
(`scripts/bridge/run_all.sh`) unchanged.
**Done when:** W-CORE-PURE PASS on the agreed core list, `forbidden=0`, red control FAILs as it should.
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

---

## PART B — One manifest per app   (fixes P2, declares half of P1)

**Design.** Each app (`viewer/`, `erp/`, `modeller/`) gets one small JSON manifest listing every module it loads, in order:
`{ "file", "deps": [...], "load": "boot" | "lazy", "lazyGroup": "find", "precache": true | false, "v": 5 }`.
A generator script (dev-side, like `scripts/gen_global_types.js`) **writes** the derived parts that are hand-kept today: the page's
`<script>` block between two marker comments, the lazy list in `viewer/main.js`, each `PRECACHE_ASSETS`, every `?v=`, and the `CACHE_VERSION` bump
when anything it covers changed. The page stays a static file. **No build step at run time:** the generated text is committed, exactly as today.
- Load order becomes **declared** (`deps`), and the generator refuses a manifest whose order breaks a dependency.
- Lazy loading becomes an explicit flag. The generator refuses `load:"lazy"` + `precache:true` unless the owner allowed it (ERP/modeller lazy
  parts ARE precached for the air gap on purpose, `erp/sw.js:408-421`, so the rule is per app: OPEN DECISION 2).
- `scripts/bump.js` becomes one line: change a module's `v` (or the generator bumps it from the content hash).

**Migration:** B0 generator in **check mode only**: build the manifest FROM today's files (pages, `main.js`, `sw.js`) and prove that regenerating
them from it is **byte-identical** to what is committed. No file changes. B1 switch one app (smallest first: modeller, 59 tags) to "manifest is the
source", generated sections between markers, byte-identical again. B2 erp, B3 viewer. `tests/audit_sw_precache.js` stays green throughout.

**OPEN DECISIONS:** 1. versions: hand-kept `v` numbers, or content hashes (`?v=<8 hex>`)? Proposal: content hash. Nobody bumps by hand, and a
stale file is impossible. But it changes every `?v=` once, so it needs owner sign-off. 2. Lazy + precache per app: viewer lazy = not precached
(today's rule), erp/modeller lazy = precached (today's rule). Confirm, or make one rule. 3. Should the manifest also carry each module's
**owner** and **witnesses**? Proposal: yes, that is how D and E get their data for free.

**Witnesses:** W-MANIFEST-ROUNDTRIP (manifest → generated text byte-identical to committed; red control: swap two dependent modules → generator
refuses) · `audit_sw_precache.js` · page boot witnesses unchanged.
**Done when:** all three apps generated from their manifests, round-trip identical, `bump.js` retired or reduced to "edit `v`".
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

---

## PART C — Named APP parts, each with one owner   (fixes the rest of P1; slow, background)

**Design.** Instead of 1,676 loose fields on one object: named parts, `APP.scene`, `APP.stream`, `APP.panels`, `APP.schedule`, `APP.film`,
`APP.find`, `APP.erp`, …, each **owned by one module** that declares its fields in a JSDoc `@typedef` (in `types/`, editor-only). A field nobody
owns is visible at once, so phantoms cannot exist, and "where is this set?" has one answer (F12 works through the typedef).
Compatibility during migration: the old flat name stays as an alias that forwards to the new place, and the alias is deleted when its last reader
moves. **Migration:** one part at a time, `scene` first (it creates `APP.camera`, `viewer/scene.js:163`). This replaces
`REFACTOR_FOR_READERS.md` item 6 (`A` → `APP` rename) and absorbs item 4 (phantoms).
**OPEN DECISIONS:** 1. The list of part names and which module owns each (proposal drawn from the folder roles in `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` §1.1). 2.
Keep `A` as the parameter name inside `setupX(A)` (less churn), or rename to `APP` while moving (greppable)? Proposal: rename while moving.
**Witnesses:** `scripts/gen_app_surface.js` counts: phantoms → 0 for migrated parts; total reads unchanged; each module's witnesses identical.
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

---

## PART D — App-wide owner table, generated   (fixes P4)

**Design.** Generalise `prompts/4D_MODEL_INTEGRITY.md` §I to the whole app: a table *question → owner file* ("what is today", "is this element
supported", "post a document", "route a pipe", …). It is generated from the manifest (B, `owner` field) plus a small hand-kept list of questions.
The generator **flags a second implementation**: a global published by two files (already detected by `scripts/gen_global_types.js`'s multi-publisher
list) or a function with the same normalised body in two files. That turns duplicates from an accident into a red check.
**OPEN DECISIONS:** 1. Where the questions list lives (proposal: next to the manifests, one JSON per app). 2. Is a namespace extended by several
files on purpose (`Bonsai.x = …` from 3 files) allowed? Proposal: yes, if the manifest marks it `"extends": "Bonsai"`.
**Witnesses:** W-OWNER-UNIQUE (every question one owner; red control: register a second owner → FAIL).
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

---

## PART E — A proof map   (fixes P5)

**Design.** Every witness declares, in its spec header, the module(s) and spec rule(s) it proves (`PROVES: viewer/db_resolve.js R1-R4`). One
generator writes the map *module → witnesses → last verdict* and *rule → witness*, from the headers plus the suite log. One runner
(`tests/run_witness_suite.js`) and one path resolver (`witness_kit/paths.js`, replacing hard-coded home folders) serve every folder. New witnesses go
in `<app>/tests/`. Existing ones are moved later, mechanically, using the map.
**OPEN DECISIONS:** 1. The header keyword (`PROVES:`) and format. 2. Does the suite log persist (like `~/.cache/bim4d/`) so the map can show last
verdicts? Proposal: yes, a small JSON per run.
**Witnesses:** W-PROOF-MAP (every production module has ≥1 witness or is listed as unproven; red control: a header naming a missing module → FAIL).
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

---

## PART F — A VS Code extension for this codebase   (owner: *"a plugin or addon that specifically handles this codebase elegantly and dev help really"*)

**Prior art, do not re-triage:** bim-ootb `prompts/DEV_TOOLKIT_NO_AI.md`, PARKED 2026-10-06, spec complete enough to build: 26 tools → 6 extensions
(X1 §-Lens, X2 Live Doctor, X3 Maps, X4 Rules, X5 Workflow, X6 Witness & Ship) on 3 engines (E1 log parser, E2 live-tab bridge, E3 static parser), a
symptom playbook (§3), first slice (§6), admin decisions (§10). It is about **runtime debugging** without AI. Its spikes S0/S2 come first.

**What this design adds: a code-structure extension, "X0 Navigator"**, built on the data parts A–E produce. It holds **no knowledge of the codebase
itself**: it only reads the generated files, so it cannot drift from the code.

| Feature | Dev's question | Reads | Available after |
|---|---|---|---|
| F12 / hover / find-references for `APP.x` and `A.x` fields (a DefinitionProvider) | "Where is this field set?" | `internal/APP_SURFACE.md` (today), named parts (C) | **now** (APP_SURFACE exists) |
| `§TAG` hover → the spec paragraph + the code that prints it | "What rule is this tag?" | prompts/docs + source (= DEV_TOOLKIT T4) | now |
| CodeLens on line 1 of every file: `boot · precache · v5 · owner: … · 3 witnesses (last: PASS)` | "How is this file loaded, who owns it, what proves it?" | manifest (B) + owner table (D) + proof map (E) | B, D, E |
| Bump on save (or a quick-fix "this precached file changed: bump?") | "Did I forget the cache bump?" | `scripts/bump.js` today, manifest (B) later | now |
| "Run the witnesses for this file", with the verdict in the Testing panel | "Did I break it?" | proof map (E), suite runner | E |
| Owner warning: "a second implementation of *what is today*" | "Am I duplicating an owner?" | owner table (D) | D (also unparks DEV_TOOLKIT T6 Owner Trace) |
| Core-purity squiggle: `Date.now()` in a core file | "Am I breaking determinism?" | W-CORE-PURE rule (A3) | A |
| Lazy/boot badge in the status bar for the open file | "Will this load at start?" | manifest (B) | B |

### F.2 Run & Ship: localhost, commit, deploy, fetch back from github.io   (owner: *"The VSC tool aid can help control launch in localhost or deploy and fetch etc"* · *"helps commit to github and run from the standard project URL github.io/"*)

The full loop a developer runs by hand today, as a panel of stepped commands. Each step prints a `§` line and stops on the first failure.
**It calls the project's existing scripts and never re-implements them** (DEV_TOOLKIT T26 Ship Runner's own rule).

| Step | What the panel does | Uses (existing) | Facts it relies on (measured 2026-11-13) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Run local** | start the static server, open the chosen app (Viewer / ERP / Modeller) in Chrome with the debugger attached; show which `CACHE_VERSION` the tab is running vs the disk | `.vscode/tasks.json` *Serve repo*, `.vscode/launch.json`; DEV_TOOLKIT T2 Version Doctor for the tab version | precached files are cache-first, so the panel warns "tab is on v1709, disk is v1710: reload / Update on reload" |
| **Check** | lint, precache audit, the witnesses for the changed files (proof map, part E), bump if a precached file changed | `npx eslint viewer modeller`, `tests/audit_sw_precache.js`, `scripts/bump.js`, `npm test -- --filter …` | |
| **Issue + commit + PR** | FOSS flow: pick or open the tracker issue, branch from fresh `main` in a worktree, commit with a conventional title, push, open the PR with `Fixes #N` and the `§` evidence pasted in | `git`, `gh` (the developer's own login) | `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` §10. **Respects the PUSH PAUSE switch** in `CLAUDE.md`: if paused, it stops after the local commit |
| **Deploy** | bim-ootb: merge the PR. **GitHub Pages serves `main` directly** (`/` root, legacy build), so merged = deployed. Docs site (BIMCompiler): `scripts/safe_gh_deploy.sh` only, dry run first. Building DBs: object storage per `deploy/OCI_UPLOAD.md` §RULES (every upload with `--content-type`) | `gh pr merge`, `scripts/safe_gh_deploy.sh`, `oci` | never bare `mkdocs gh-deploy` (`CLAUDE.md` §Docs deploy) |
| **Fetch back** | wait for Pages, then fetch from the **project URL** (`https://red1oon.github.io/bim-ootb/<app>/…`, docs `https://red1oon.github.io/BIMCompiler/…`): HTTP 200 for each changed file, live `CACHE_VERSION` == `main`, live bytes == committed bytes (hash), and the page's boot `§` lines from a headless check if the owner allows | `curl`/fetch; the DEV_TOOLKIT T26 steps 7–10 | today live == main for all three apps (viewer v1709, erp v1064, modeller v272). A green pipeline is not a deployed feature: always fetch (`prompts/AGENT_QUEUE.md`, this repo) |
| **Open live** | open the github.io URL of the app being worked on, the same way users reach it | | |

Rules for F.2: no step runs without the developer pressing it. Deploy and push steps show what they will do and ask first. Headless browser checks only
with the owner's go (GPU/VRAM contention with a live session is a known crash, memory `feedback_gpu_vram_contention_crashes_user_tab`).
Witness `W-SHIP-PANEL` (node, fixtures): a sandbox repo where (a) a planted syntax error stops at Check, (b) a precached file changed without a bump stops
at Check, (c) a fake "live" server returning an old `CACHE_VERSION` makes Fetch back FAIL. **Red control:** compare against a wrong hash, which must FAIL.
OPEN DECISION 5 (F): does Fetch back run a headless browser for the boot `§` lines, or only HTTP + version + hash? Proposal: HTTP + version + hash by
default. Headless is a button the owner enables.

### F.3 What advanced teams built, adapted here + a "what will this cost if deployed" monitor   (owner: *"suggest things that advanced devs have done in tools that can help here"* · *"with monitors that can tell its perf impact if deployed"*)

Well-known tools, named as **prior art to copy the idea from, not to install** (each would be a new dependency; the adaptation is a small
dev-side script or an X0 feature). The descriptions are general knowledge, not measured here.

| Prior art (what it does there) | The idea | Adapted here |
|---|---|---|
| **size-limit / bundlesize**: fail a PR whose JS grows past a budget, and comment the delta | a size budget per entry point | **boot-bytes and precache-bytes per app**, computed from the manifest (B) or, until then, from page tags + `PRECACHE_ASSETS`. The PR shows `viewer boot +12 KB · precache +0`. Over budget = red |
| **Import Cost** (VS Code: size shown next to each import) | see the cost while typing | CodeLens on line 1: `boot · 84 KB · every user pays this at start` vs `lazy (find) · 0 at start` |
| **bundle analyzer treemaps** | see where the bytes are | treemap of each app's boot bytes by folder/family (viewer `fx_*`, `tm_*`, …) |
| **Chrome DevTools Coverage** (JS loaded but never run) | find code that should not be at boot | a headless boot of each app (owner's go) lists boot files that ran **zero** functions, as candidates for the lazy list |
| **Lighthouse CI**: run a page per PR, assert budgets (load time, blocking time), keep history | measured budgets per PR | for the ERP shell (no WebGL, cheap): time to `§INIT`, using the browser's built-in `performance.mark/measure` (today **0** files use them; add marks, no library) |
| **continuous benchmarking with bisect** (e.g. the Rust compiler's perf site, Chromium's perf dashboard): run fixed benchmarks on each commit, flag regressions, bisect to the commit | a perf history per commit | the `§` heap/verts lines the PERF BUDGET already asks for, collected per commit for fixed reference buildings into a JSON history (DEV_TOOLKIT T21 Perf-budget history); a jump flags and names the commit range |
| **Danger.js / PR bots**: rules that comment on a PR ("changed X without Y") | project laws as PR checks | a plain-node CI step: `sw.js` changed without `CACHE_VERSION` · lazy module added to precache · `Date.now` in a core file · new global missing from `eslint.globals.json`. Reuses W-CORE-PURE, `audit_sw_precache.js`, the manifest checks |
| **CODEOWNERS** (GitHub asks the owner to review paths they own) | route a change to its owner | generated from the owner table (D): each lane's files list the session/person to ask, so the X0 panel says "ask <owner> before editing" |
| **mutation testing (Stryker)**: change the code on purpose, check that a test fails | prove tests can fail | automated red controls: flip one comparison in the module a witness PROVES (E) and check the witness goes red (DEV_TOOLKIT T14/T25) |
| **preview/canary deploys** (a per-PR preview URL before production) | see it live before users do | `deploy/dev/` already exists as the dev target (`CLAUDE.md` PRIME RULE). The Ship panel's "Preview" step publishes there and runs Fetch back against it before the `main` merge |
| **real-user monitoring** | perf from real users | **not adopted: the app is local-first and air-gapped, so no phone-home.** Instead a local *flight recorder*: the user can export their own `§PERF` lines on request |

**The perf-impact monitor ("what will this cost if deployed"):** shown in the PR and in the X0 panel *before* merge, in three tiers:
1. **Static, always (no browser, deterministic):** boot bytes and precache bytes per app, diff vs `main`; files moved between boot and lazy;
   new geometry passes without a cost `§` line.
2. **Model estimate, always:** for a change that adds geometry, the vertex delta on the reference buildings (from the cached runs, like
   `~/.cache/bim4d/`) times the measured fit **heap ≈ 0.173 GB per million vertices** (`docs/BrowserScaleBenchmark.md`, r = 0.997 over 3 buildings, "treat as
   indicative"). Shown as an estimated peak heap per building, against a phone line (the PERF BUDGET's *unverified* ~0.6 GB / ~4 M verts per tab).
3. **Measured, only with the owner's go:** headless boot of the reference pages on the PR build vs `main`: time to `§INIT`, `performance.memory` heap,
   draw calls, verts. A regression beyond the threshold (OPEN DECISION 6) flags the PR, and the history (above) bisects it. Never run beside a live
   session's GPU work.
**Witness `W-PERF-IMPACT`:** fixture PRs where (a) a boot script is added → boot bytes rise by exactly that file's size, (b) a lazy module is moved to
boot → flagged, (c) a planted +1 M-vertex pass → estimate rises by ≈ 0.17 GB. **Red control:** a change with no cost must show zero delta.
**OPEN DECISION 6 (F):** the budgets: per-app boot-bytes ceiling, allowed heap growth per PR, `§INIT` time regression threshold, and which reference
buildings (proposal: the three in `BrowserScaleBenchmark.md`, named by role, not by client).

**AI assistance is the developer's choice, never required** (owner: *"it can allow code-assist on user choice as there are those plugins for
that, but at least make it resourceful"*). Every feature above works with no AI, no network and no account. That is the point of the
extension: the project's knowledge (patterns, owners, rules, proofs) is **in the tool, not in an assistant's head**. For a developer who *chooses*
an AI assistant plugin (any of the existing ones), X0 makes that assistant better informed, without the extension itself ever calling a model:
- **"Context for this file"** command: assembles, from the generated data only, the file's spec header, owner, load mode (boot/lazy, precache),
  witnesses and last verdicts, the `§` tags it prints, and the project rules that apply (minimalism, twin, AD-layer, no `Date.now` in core) into a
  markdown block. It is copied to the clipboard or opened beside the code, ready to paste into whatever assistant the developer uses.
- **Optional assistant tools:** where the developer's assistant supports VS Code's own extension points for chat participants/tools (e.g. a
  `@bim` participant, or tools such as "who owns X", "which witness proves this file"), X0 registers them, **off by default** and switched on in
  settings. They answer from the same generated files, so the assistant gets facts, not guesses.
- **Never:** the extension does not call a model, send code anywhere, or need an API key. No paid calls (standing rule). Anything an assistant does
  is the developer's own plugin, on their own account, by their own choice.
OPEN DECISION 4 (F): register assistant tools at all (off by default), or only the "Context for this file" command? Proposal: start with the
command only. It works with every assistant and needs no API surface that may change.

**Shape:** one extension pack, plain JavaScript using only the `vscode` API (no npm dependencies, no compile step), in `bim-ootb/devtools/` (the
folder DEV_TOOLKIT chose). **Install without a marketplace or internet:** symlink/copy the folder into `~/.vscode/extensions/` (works air-gapped).
Optional `.vsix` packaging only if the owner wants it (it needs the `vsce` tool, a dev-side dependency).
**Order inside F:** X0's "now" rows first (APP field F12, `§TAG` hover, bump on save). They need nothing else and give the most daily help. Then
DEV_TOOLKIT's first slice (§6). Then the rows that wait on B/D/E.
**OPEN DECISIONS:** 1. One extension pack (X0 + X1–X6) or separate extensions? Proposal: one pack, features switchable. 2. Folder install only, or
also `.vsix`? 3. Should "bump on save" be automatic or a prompt? Proposal: a prompt (a quick-fix), never silent.
**Witnesses:** each feature has a node test that runs its provider against fixture files (no VS Code needed for the logic), e.g. W-X0-APPDEF: for
20 sampled `APP.x` reads, the provider returns the `APP_SURFACE.md` definition line (red control: a phantom field → "no definition", not a wrong one).
**DECISIONS:** *(none yet)*

## §ORDER — why A → B → D → E → F → C

A is the only part tied to correctness (replay, posting dates), and A0 is cheap and settles a real question. B removes a whole class of stale-file
mistakes and is the data source for D, E and half of F. D and E are small once B exists. F's first features need nothing (start them in parallel if a
second session is free). C is long and best done slowly, module by module, after B/D make ownership visible.

## §M — re-measure before quoting

| Number | Command (bim-ootb root) |
|---|---|
| APP fields / phantoms | `node scripts/gen_app_surface.js` → header of `internal/APP_SURFACE.md` |
| script tags per page | `grep -cE '<script[^>]+src=' viewer/viewer.html erp/idempiere.html modeller/modeller.html` |
| core clock/random calls | the 2026-11-13 probe was NOT committed (session scratchpad). Re-create it as part of A3 (`W-CORE-PURE`): espree AST over `erp/*.js` production files, count `Date.now()`, `new Date()` with no args, `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()`/`getRandomValues()`, `fetch()`. Comments never count. Baseline it must reproduce: 299 files, 59 with calls, 181 calls; core 15 files / 26 calls |
| UMD globals F12 can follow | `node scripts/tests/witness_global_types.js` |
| multi-publisher globals | header of `types/globals.gen.d.ts` (`node scripts/gen_global_types.js`) |
| witnesses per folder | `git ls-files | grep -E 'witness[^/]*\.js$' | cut -d/ -f1-2 | sort | uniq -c` |

## Relation to other files

- `prompts/REFACTOR_FOR_READERS.md`: the small, readability-only items. Items 4 and 6 are absorbed by part C, item 3 by D, items 7 and 8 by E.
  Items 1, 2 and 5 stay there.
- `prompts/BACKEND_SUBSTRATE_LANE.md`: owns determinism. Part A runs under its rules.
- bim-ootb `prompts/DEV_TOOLKIT_NO_AI.md`: owns the runtime-debugging extensions. Part F adds X0 Navigator on top.
- `docs/DeveloperGuide.md`: update §1 (patterns) and §5 (change flow) as each part lands.
